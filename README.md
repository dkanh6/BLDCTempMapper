# BLDCTempMapper
Simulation tool for hobbyists, researchers, etc that provides dynamic temperature estimates. 

Example below uses default values and has a period no motor movement with current = 0 from 300s - 400s. The first third simulates a walking gait of a quadruped robot (based on loose currnet estimates), second third is a trot, and the last third is a running gait.
